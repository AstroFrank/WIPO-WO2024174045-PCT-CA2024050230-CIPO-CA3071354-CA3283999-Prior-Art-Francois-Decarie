WIPO-WO2024174045-PCT/CA2024/050230-CIPO-CA3071354-Prior-Art-Francois-Decarie

This page describes the Prior Art created by François Decarie before 24 Feb 2023, which is the priority date for a patent application that was filed by Dr. Charles Grant without recognizing François Decarie's intellectual property rights or his contributions, his status as an inventor. The intent of this page is to demonstrate that the patent application is invalidate due to incorrect inventorship, the inventive process is laid out with timestamps as they relate to all claims of the application. <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2024174045&_gid=202435"> WIPO PCT Application. </a>

François Decarie is a PhD student at the University of Manitoba, after serving 22 years in the Canadian Armed Forces. François met Dr. Grant (a senior instructor at the University of Manitoba) through a mutual friend in 2022, and with François' previous Master of Computer Science and personal experience with artificial intelligence, electro-optical systems and the IoT, began working with Dr. Grant informally on a system for accurately weighing pigs in a barn setting. Throughout 2022 and 2023, François' work inspired him, at Dr. Grant's suggestion, to enroll at the University of Manitoba and use the work he had already completed with Dr. Grant for his PhD. Although not known to François at the time, it became clear that Dr. Grant's ulterior motive was to use the University of Manitoba's Collaborative Research Agreement process to assign François' IP to a hastely incorporated company that Dr. Grant co-owns, thereby circumventing the need to recognize François' work.

Unbeknownst to François until recently August 2025, Dr. Grant had previously filed a patent application CA3071354 in 2018 with claims that have since been abandoned. <a href="https://cipo.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/3071354/summary.html?query=charles+grant&type=basic_search"> Abandoned CIPO Application. </a>

Previous Claims:
From Previous application:"2D images and Algorithms for Predicting Carcass Lean Yields for Live Feeder Pigs and for Body Condition Scoring Breeder Sows
Claims

A system and method of using 2D images of live feeder pigs and algorithms to predict carcass lean yields to allow adjustments in rations to optimize carcass lean yield.
A system and method of using 2D images of gestating sows and algorithms to body condition score those sows to allow adjustments in rations to optimize the body conditions to increase litter size.
A system and method whereby 2D images of feeder pigs are captured.
A system and method whereby the 2D images are transferred to an in-barn computer where data is extracted from the images.
A system and method whereby the image data is transferred to a central server located off-site.
A system and method whereby, at the server, the carcass lean yield predictions of feeder pigs and body condition scoring of gestating sows are calculated.
A system and method whereby reports of the predicted carcass lean yields and body conditions of gestating sows are transferred to mobile phones for the use of barn and slaughter plant managers.CA 3071354 2020-02-06"

Dr. Grant's background is in agricultural business, actuarial accounting, insurance sales and certainly not in computer programming. His previous patent application was abandoned because he failed to develop the invention. When François became involved in the fall of 2022, François took the lead on all technical matters, while Dr. Grant facilitated barn visits and ordering material specified by François.Correspondence is provided, in which the metadata can verify the dates of creation of the images and videos.

Following approximately one year of work, on late January 2022, François provided a demonstration of his work to Dr. Grant and Dr. Grant's business partner in Niverville, Mb. The demonstration was well received, as noted in the chat messages. Dr. Grant and his business partner, based on the results of François' demonstration, incorporated a company on February 21, 2023, called Moccus Maximus, Inc. Two days later, on February 23, 2023, Moccus Maximus filed a patent priority document. 

The video of the demo is here; you'll note that Dr Grant was assisting the demo by holding the pig cut out, the voice explaining what the system does is that of François Decarie, who was filming and operating the station control.

Later, after priority but before filing, in pursuing further invention definition, Dr. Grant required François to provide all technical details, notably Figures 7 and 8 of the patent application, to the patent agent, Mr. John Orange. The technical wording in the patent is nearly verbatim to what François provided to Mr. Orange.

In conclusion, François conceived all technical details of the dynamic pig scaling model and did all of the coding for this project himself. Dr. Grant did not create code and he demonstrably does not understand François' work. François was never an employee of Moccus Maximus, nor did he have any formal agreement with Moccus Maximus. This patent was filed with no ackowledgement of the true inventor, François Decarie, and the evidence provided on this page is conclusively supportive of this fact. Further analysis and context can be provided by contacting François Decarie.
